	<p>The Lorem ipsum text is derived from sections 1.10.32 and
		1.10.33 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum.[1][2] The physical
		source may have been the 1914 Loeb Classical Library edition of De
		finibus, where the Latin text, presented on the left-hand (even)
		pages, breaks off on page 34 with "Neque porro quisquam est qui do-"
		and continues on page 36 with "lorem ipsum ...", suggesting that the
		galley type of that page was mixed up to make the dummy text seen
		today.[3] The discovery of the text's origin is attributed to Richard
		McClintock, a Latin scholar at Hampden–Sydney College. McClintock
		connected Lorem ipsum to Cicero's writing sometime before 1982 while
		searching for instances of the Latin word consectetur, which was
		rarely used in classical literature.[4] McClintock first published his
		discovery in a 1994 letter to the editor of Before & After magazine,
		contesting the editor's earlier claim that Lorem ipsum had no
		meaning.[5]</p>
